# Grocery App

Demo app to test [ReactNative](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) with [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com)

In order to integrate Firebase I've to use a [Firebase Bridge](https://github.com/davecoates/rn-firebase-bridge) it is awesome.

To use your own Firebase Database follow the steps described [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

For now it runs just in android.
